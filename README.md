# Spongemock Me

**Context:**

This site is based on the rather popular [Mocking Spongebob meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob). I suggest you familiarize yourself with it because it's hilarious and incredibly applicable in all kinds of situations.

**Why:**

I constantly structure my texts based on the meme when I message people and it takes me quite a bit of thinking to decide which letters to capitalize or not. I wanted a simple interface to do the job quickly and effectively to remove this burden from myself.

**Additional notes:**

- The ultimate goal is to port this over to a browser extension so that you can convert your desired text more instantaneously.
- I'd like to add "Add to clipboard" functionality to it, but using the API seems a little more complicated than I would've expected.
- I highly doubt that this looks good on mobile, so that's a work in progress.
